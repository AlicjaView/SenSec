# SenSec - System Monitoring, Analysis, and Security Tool
IN PREPARATION!

SenSec is an advanced tool created in Python that enables the monitoring, analysis, and security of computer systems. The project provides support for system protection, identification of potential threats, and response to unusual activities.

# Features

- System Log Monitoring: SenSec analyzes system logs to identify failed login attempts, unusual activity, and system changes.

- Attack Pattern Identification: Using the AttackPatternAnalyzer module, SenSec can detect attack patterns such as SQL injection attempts and brute force attacks.

- Vulnerability Analysis: SenSec allows for the analysis of system vulnerabilities, detection of security loopholes, and implementation of corrective actions.

- Advanced Network Scanning: Through the scanning module, SenSec can scan networks to find vulnerable hosts and potential threats.

  ```python
  DB_HOST = "localhost"
  DB_PORT = 5432
  DB_USERNAME = "your_db_user"
  DB_PASSWORD = "your_db_password"
  DB_NAME = "your_db_name"
  ```

- Email Notification Settings: Provide your email login credentials to configure email notifications. Also, enter the administrator's email address.

  ```python
  EMAIL_ADDRESS = "your_email@example.com"
  EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_email_password"
  ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"
  ```

- Other Settings: Customize other settings, such as the log file path or debug mode, according to your preferences.

  ```python
  LOG_FILE_PATH = "security_analysis.log"
  DEBUG_MODE = False
  ```
